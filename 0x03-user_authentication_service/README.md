This service provides finctionality for user registration, login, logout, password reset and user profile management.Through various routes, users can register, log in with secure password handling, access their profiles, log out, and request password resets. The project also includes features like generating and managing session IDs, implementing token-based password reset functionality, and ensuring secure authentication and authorization for user interactions.
